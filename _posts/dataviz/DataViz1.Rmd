|S/N| Critique Area  |Description                                                   |
|---|----------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
|1  |Clarity                                              |The chart is not representative of what the accompanying text was trying to convey. The accompanying text focuses on resident labour force of age 25 to 54 and 55 a & above, but the chart binned he age in groups of 5 years. Moreover, the text mentioned about the increase of Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for resident labour force aged 25 to 54 from 2009 to 2019, but LFPR was not even shown in the chart.|
|2  |Clarity                                              |The age in the x-axis is binned, such that 40-44 years old is in one bin. However, the chart attempted to show an increase of median age of the labour force from 41 to 44 years old by showing a shift in the median age by 3 years within the same bin. This representation is misleading and should be avoided.|
|3  |Clarity                                              |It is not clear to the readers to be able to observe the increase of the share of residents aged 55 & over in the labour force at first glance |
|4  |Aesthetics                                              |The colour theme used is simple and clear, will adopt the simplistic approach in visualization.|
|5  |Aesthetics                                              |There is not tick mark for the y axis, viewers must look at both the table and the graph to make sense out of it. Tick marks should be added|
|6  |Aesthetics                                              |The axis label is located at an odd position, outside the chart area. It is non-intuitive for reader to understand the representation of the y-axis at first glance|
|7  |Aesthetics                                              |The chart is unable to display all the information described in the accompany text. More visualizations are needed to display all of the information.|


# b.     Proposed alternative data visualisation


```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, layout ='1-body-outset', fig.width=12, fig.height=6}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/Personal/SMU/2021/Visual Analytics/Distill Blog 1/_posts/dataviz/DataViz1_files/Images/proposed_cropped.jpg")
```

The proposed visualization is designed to overcome the misrepresentation of the original chart. The age groups are now binned according to the age band described by the accompany text in "25-54" and "55 & abv".\ 

Next, It would also display the changes of the age group composition of the labour force.\ 

Lastly, the visualization would also display teh changes of the LFPR by each age group.

# e.    Observations from Final Visualization


```{r fig.cap="*Final Visualization*", out.extra="class=external"}
knitr::include_graphics("D:/Personal/SMU/2021/Visual Analytics/Distill Blog 1/_posts/dataviz/DataViz1_files/Images/final_visual.jpg")
```


Age group 55 & abv shows increase in most of the years between 2009 and 2019. This suggests that the LFPR of the older resident increases as Singapore experiences ageing population.

Age group 25-54 has also shown increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 despite its decreasing share in labour force. This suggests that the resident labour force is ageing as well.

There is an increase in the total resident labour force from 2009 and 2019 despite the effects of ageing population.
