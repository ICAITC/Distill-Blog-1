Critiques and Suggestions for Current Visualisations\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nS/N\r\nCritique Area\r\nDescription\r\n1\r\nClarity\r\nThe chart is not representative of what the accompanying text was trying to convey. The accompanying text focuses on resident labour force of age 25 to 54 and 55 a & above, but the chart binned he age in groups of 5 years. Moreover, the text mentioned about the increase of Labour Force Participation Rate (LFPR) for resident labour force aged 25 to 54 from 2009 to 2019, but LFPR was not even shown in the chart.\r\n2\r\nClarity\r\nThe age in the x-axis is binned, such that 40-44 years old is in one bin. However, the chart attempted to show an increase of median age of the labour force from 41 to 44 years old by showing a shift in the median age by 3 years within the same bin. This representation is misleading and should be avoided.\r\n3\r\nClarity\r\nIt is not clear to the readers to be able to observe the increase of the share of residents aged 55 & over in the labour force at first glance\r\n4\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe colour theme used is simple and clear, will adopt the simplistic approach in visualization.\r\n5\r\nAesthetics\r\nThere is not tick mark for the y axis, viewers must look at both the table and the graph to make sense out of it. Tick marks should be added\r\n6\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe axis label is located at an odd position, outside the chart area. It is non-intuitive for reader to understand the representation of the y-axis at first glance\r\n7\r\nAesthetics\r\nThe chart is unable to display all the information described in the accompany text. More visualizations are needed to display all of the information.\r\nb. Proposed alternative data visualisation\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe proposed visualization is designed to overcome the misrepresentation of the original chart. The age groups are now binned according to the age band described by the accompany text in “25-54” and “55 & abv”. \r\nNext, It would also display the changes of the age group composition of the labour force. \r\nLastly, the visualization would also display teh changes of the LFPR by each age group.\r\nd. Step-by-step description of visualization\r\ns/n\r\nArea\r\nAction\r\n1\r\nThe original data source is not in a report summary format where the rows do not represent the individual records of the data and direct import of such data would result in inaccuracy \r\nCheck “Cleaned with Data Intepreter” to clean up the format  \r\n2\r\nColumn “F1” is not applicable in the visualization\r\nColumn is hidden away. \r\n3\r\nThe years are split into respective columns. It limits the visualization aspect.\r\nPivoting the data to collapse the years into a single column and rename the pivoted columns to “Year” “Age” and “Labour Force Participation Rate”. \r\n4\r\nRemnants of summary report that are not required in the visualization, like “Total” in “Age Group”, “25 – 64” is present. \r\nFilter is applied to get the age groups in the bins of 5 years.  \r\n5\r\nExport data\r\nThe transformed data is copied in the Microsoft Excel and is saved.\r\n6\r\nThe data source contains information on resident labour force participation rate by age, but it does not contain data on the labour force population by age.\r\nAnother data table is required to provide the data on labour force population. Such data is found on the same publication as the original data source, at https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx, Table 7: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE AGED FIFTEEN YEARS AND OVER BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 -2019 (JUNE)\r\n7\r\nFormat of data is similar to Table 5, transformation required.\r\nStep 1 to 5 is repeated for Table 7.\r\n8\r\nCombining 2 data sources\r\nThe 2 data sources are combined into one data table using inner join. As the data tables are in pivot format, the inner join is on both “Age” and “Year in order to ensure 1:1 join relationship. \r\n9\r\nCreate new group [Age Group]\r\nThe Age are grouped into “15-24”, “25-54” and “55 & Abv” as this would be reflective to the description of the text accompanying the visualization. \r\n10\r\nData could not be published on Tableau Public\r\nThe data needs to be changed to “Extract” for the data to be published on Tableau. \r\n11\r\nCreate calculated field [Labour Force Participation]\r\n|\r\n12\r\nCreate calculated field [Total Labour Force]\r\nThis is to get the total labour force per year. \r\n13\r\nCreate calculated field [Share of Labour Force]\r\nThis is to get the share of the labour force per age group per year. \r\n14\r\nConvert [Year] to discrete\r\nThis would make filtering year 2009 and 2019 easier. \r\n15\r\nCreating Pie Chart to display changes in age composition of labour force from 2009 to 2019\r\nFitlering of year. \r\n16\r\nContinued…\r\nColumn settings. \r\n17\r\nContinued…\r\nOther Parameters \r\n18\r\nContinued…\r\nThe labels settings. \r\n19\r\nTransforming into Donut Chart\r\nThe pie chart is insufficient to present all of the information required, thus, the pie chart is converted to a donut chart.\r\n20\r\nContinued…\r\nCreation of dummy calculated field for donut chart \r\n21\r\nContinued…\r\nCreate a dual axis using the dummy measure value with dual axis \r\n22\r\nContinued…\r\nSet the second chart as circle. Use [Total Labour Force] as the label and adjust position it in the centre of the donut.\r\nThe centre of the donut chart will have labels that include the total labour force of the respective years and the median age.\r\nThe median age is created using calculated field with the following formula: if [Year] = 2009 then 41 elseif [Year] = 2019 then 44 END \r\n23\r\nContinued…\r\nChange the colour to white and reduce the size so that a donut is formed. \r\n24\r\nContinued…\r\nThe label is then customized to display teh crucial information. \r\n25\r\nCreating line chart that depicts the changes in LFPR in each age group from 2009 and 2019\r\nThis chart would shows the trend, changes of the LFPR over the 10 years\r\n26\r\nCreate calculated field [LFP Age Group] for each age group\r\n\r\n27\r\nCreate calculated field [Labour Force Age Group] for each age group\r\n\r\n28\r\nCreate calculated field [LDPR Age Group] for each age group\r\n\r\n29\r\nSetting parameters of the line chart\r\nQuick table calculation of “Difference” is applied onto [LFPR Age Group]. This would allow the line chart to display the percentage difference. \r\n30\r\nDashboard of the visualization.\r\nBoth the donut and the line charts are placed in the dashboard to show the neccesary data.\r\ne. Observations from Final Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure 1: Final Visualization\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAge group 55 & abv shows increase in most of the years between 2009 and 2019. This suggests that the LFPR of the older resident increases as Singapore experiences ageing population.\r\nAge group 25-54 has also shown increase in LFPR from 2009 to 2019 despite its decreasing share in labour force. This suggests that the resident labour force is ageing as well.\r\nThere is an increase in the total resident labour force from 2009 and 2019 despite the effects of ageing population.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
